# mho LaTeX

This repository is a collection of my public facing tex files 
and my custom style files.  Some files will not work out of the 
box because the appropriate assets, such as images, are not 
part of this repository.  However, I do hope that this brings 
someone a little tex inspiration for their own setup much in the 
same way that I have benefited from the shared work of others.
