# mho LaTeX (maybe someday Typst)

This repository serves as a collection of my public-facing LaTeX (often pronounced "Lay-tech" or "Lah-tech") files, accompanied by my custom style files and management scripts (currently written in Python).

Please be aware that some of these files might not compile successfully right out-of-the-box. This is mainly due to certain assets, like images, that are required but not included in this repository due to size constrains.

I genuinely hope that my work sparks a bit of LaTeX inspiration in your projects. I've been greatly inspired by the generous contributions of the community, and I aim to give back in the same spirit.

As of November 2023, I am contemplating making the switch to [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst), which is a markup-based typesetter built using Rust and has a much cleaning syntax that just fells modern.

Happy TeX-ing!
