# mho LaTeX

Welcome to this repository! It serves as a collection of my public-facing LaTeX (often pronounced "Lay-tech" or "Lah-tech") files, accompanied by my custom style files.

Please be aware that some of these files might not compile successfully right out-of-the-box. This is mainly due to certain assets, like images, that are required but not included in this repository.

I genuinely hope that my work sparks a bit of LaTeX inspiration in your projects. I've been greatly inspired by the generous contributions of the community, and I aim to give back in the same spirit.

Happy TeX-ing!
