# mho Bespoke Notes 

This repository serves as a collection of my public-facing notes which are currently typeset using LaTeX (often pronounced "Lay-tech" or "Lah-tech").  
It also contains the custom style files, the python scripts, some of the assets, and parts of my org-mode denote knowledge system that I use to annotate and link my notes.

In addition to my notes, you will also find the templates that I use to create slide decks, generate exams and produce worksheets. 

Please be aware that some of these files might not compile successfully right out-of-the-box. This is mainly due to certain assets, like images, that are required but not included in this repository due to size constrains.

I genuinely hope that my work sparks a bit of LaTeX inspiration in your projects. I've been greatly inspired by the generous contributions of the community, and I aim to give back in the same spirit.

As of November 2023, I am contemplating making the switch to [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst), which is a markup-based typesetter built using Rust. While it has a much cleaner syntax, easier to program and is super fast to compile documents, I am waiting for the platform to mature a little more.

Happy TeX-ing!
